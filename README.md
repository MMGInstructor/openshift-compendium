This repo contains handy commands, snippets and other tips + tricks for working with OpenShift Container Platform.

## Contributing Guidelines

A few points to note when submitting PRs:

- Tags are case sensitive
  - `Admin Tasks` is different from `Admin tasks`
  - Use existing tags wherever possible
- Links and emoji are optional
- Code blocks support multilanguage syntax highlighting with [Github flavored markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Front Matter

Each note should contain some front matter. This allows the theme to parse and organize the contents more easily. 

For example:

```
---
title: Display etcd member table
tags:
  - Openshift 4
  - Admin Tasks
  - etcd
emoji: ðŸ§¹
link: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4985441
---
```

## Dev environment

* Ensure you have npm installed
* Then `npm install -g gatsby-cli` 
* Followed by `npm install` to update local package info
* To build the site run `gatsby build` and to serve it `gatsby serve`
